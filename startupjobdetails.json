    "description": " The opportunity Your team The team is currently the founders, Pranav and Pete, and Hourann, Daniel, and Jason, our first engineers. We believe that the best teams are driven from the bottom up. We’re excited for how you will influence us. Your role Paramark is hiring a Founding Customer Success lead. The core responsibility of this role will be to manage the end to end customer experience from the moment a contract is signed to a successful renewal and beyond. As the sole Customer Success team member, you'll also be responsible for creating the playbooks that will help us scale 5-10x in the next two years. This role will require a strong foundation in data, strategic thinking, and exec communication skills. What will this role involve? Onboarding & Implementation. You'll work with the customer and your Solutions Engineering counterpart to configure Paramark's offering to the customers' needs. Strategic Advisory. You'll help the customer with strategic topics like change management, best practices around data, and learning more about measuring incrementality. This will involve regular customer success calls, helping the customer with internal presentations, and generally advancing the goals of the customer. Account Management. Build and manage strategic relationships with key stakeholders across customer organizations. Develop account plans that align with customer goals and the product’s capabilities. Engage with C-level stakeholders to ensure that the product is delivering on value. Identify and execute on upsell and cross-sell opportunities. Process Design and Implementation. As we grow, you'll build processes for onboarding, support, and retention. Implement key metrics (e.g., Customer Satisfaction Scores) and track KPIs to measure success. Customer Advocacy. You will be the voice of the customer and integrate feedback into product development and go-to-market strategy. Advocate for the customer’s needs internally to ensure product and services meet expectations. Ensure that customer challenges are quickly addressed to build trust and loyalty. What will it take to be successful in this role? You’ll need to understand and explain how marketing works — theory, metrics, measurement methodologies, pros and cons of various approaches. You’ll have to be fluent in data-driven decision making. Measuring what truly matters is half the battle. Knowing what matters is critical. You’ll need strong analytical skills and familiarity with statistical concepts like confidence intervals and uncertainty. Familiarity with SQL, Python, or R are a plus. You will have to collaborate with Solutions Engineers and sweat the details. You’ll need to deliver business change based on data in the face of potentially skeptical stakeholders. You’ll have to exude a calm and confident communication, project management, and cross-functional leadership skillset to influence and persuade. Analytics, consulting, or banking experience are a plus. However, if you possess these skills without that background, we’d love to chat with you too. Contributing to product definition You will influence what we build. We believe that for what we’re building, customer feedback is essential at every step of the way. You will participate in customer research, and this will inform the product decisions the company will be making. Your interests Creating happy customers. Your choices will be guided by a passion to make our customers happy. Creating a warm and welcoming company culture. Building a great product is only the beginning for us. We’re equally passionate about building a company that we still want to work at 10 years from now, and you will play a huge role in making this happen. Contribute to our marketing and sales engine. As our first go-to-market (GTM) hire, your fingerprints will be all over each part of our GTM stack. Your skills will fit some areas better than others, but you will grow with time.

The company We are building a product to help Marketers optimize their spend across any number of channels and programs. There are proven scientific ways to do this, but they are poorly understood and practiced by only a tiny fraction of teams. Companies waste millions on campaigns that don’t work, while failing to invest in critical long-term initiatives whose impact is harder to measure. Most are sorely lacking in both measurement and experimentation capability. We’re fixing this by creating a system of record that teams will use to understand and forecast the impact of their Marketing, as well as to experiment with new ideas. The opportunity is huge: 300k+ mid-market businesses worldwide, spending $1T on marketing annually, with a large chunk of that going to waste. Our target customer spends between $10M and $100M on Marketing annually. We founded the company in 2023 and are seeing strong traction. We have 8 recurring customers (3 enterprise, 5 mid-market), 9 in progress pilots, and 20+ in early sales stages. Revenue is growing faster each quarter than the last. We work 3-5 days a week from our office in Burlingame, CA, and we’re moving to San Francisco in the coming weeks.  We thrive on in-person collaboration, but we also want to strike the right balance and give everyone the flexibility they need. We’ve raised $8M from top tier investors and have several prominent CXO-level advisors and angels from companies like Dropbox, Salesforce, PagerDuty, Miro, Webflow, Asana, Pilot, Otter.ai, and Gong.io.
